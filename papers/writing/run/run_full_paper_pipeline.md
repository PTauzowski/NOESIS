name: run_full_paper_pipeline
description: Execute the full paper pipeline across literature, writing, validation, positioning, and submission readiness
---

ROLE:
Execute the full paper pipeline autonomously.

INPUT:
- Use the currently focused document as the manuscript source
- Use the project codebase (via VSCode access)
- Use references/ as the literature source
- Use existing intermediate outputs if already available
- Do not ask the user to paste sections again

ALWAYS LOAD:
- writing/policies/STYLE_LOCK-papers.md
- writing/workflows/writing.md

MISSION:
Produce a submission-ready manuscript workflow outcome by:
- grounding literature claims in references/
- grounding methodology in code
- validating claims against results
- stress-testing the gap and novelty
- assessing submission readiness
- recommending journal strategy

CORE PRINCIPLE:
The paper must be written and validated from evidence, not from persuasive wording.

DO NOT:
- invent literature claims
- invent methodological details
- skip validation stages
- globally rewrite sections when local fixes suffice
- assume results support claims without checking
- overclaim novelty or significance

# PIPELINE OVERVIEW

The pipeline has 5 layers:

1. LITERATURE PREPARATION
2. SECTION WRITING
3. VALIDATION
4. SUBMISSION DECISION
5. JOURNAL STRATEGY

---

# STEP 0 — PRECONDITION CHECK

Confirm availability of:
- focused manuscript
- references/
- codebase access

Classify availability:

### REQUIRED
- manuscript
- references/ for Introduction / Related Work
- code for Methodology

If manuscript missing:
- STOP

If references/ missing:
- STOP before literature-driven sections

If code missing:
- STOP before Methodology pipeline

Output:
- precondition status
- missing dependencies

---

# STEP 0.5 — REFERENCE SNAPSHOT AUDIT (runs before any writing)

Run:
- writing/prompts/reference_snapshot_audit.md

This step executes immediately after precondition checks and before any section writing.
It compares required_disclosures from paper_contract.json against the reference snapshot
in ai/config/reference_snapshot/ (if present) and produces a gap report.

Output:
- ai/out/reference_gap_report.md (PRESENT / ABSENT / LOW_CONFIDENCE per disclosure ID)

This report is advisory — it generates REQUIRED_CONTENT hints passed to section writers.
It does not block the pipeline on its own; absent disclosures block at the section audit stage.

If ai/config/reference_snapshot/ does not exist: skip silently, write empty gap report.
If ai/config/paper_contract.json does not exist: skip silently.

---

# STEP 1 — LITERATURE PREPARATION

## 1A. LITERATURE EXTRACTION
Run:
- writing/prompts/literature_extract.md

Goal:
- extract structured evidence from references/

Output:
- per-paper extraction
- method map
- assumption map
- evidence map
- gap candidates

## 1B. LITERATURE BALANCE
Run:
- writing/prompts/literature_balance.md

Goal:
- ensure balanced and representative literature coverage
- identify missing method families or narrative bias

Output:
- family coverage
- missing perspectives
- rebalancing plan

Gate:
If literature coverage is insufficient:
- mark Introduction / Related Work as literature-limited
- continue, but report risk explicitly

---

# STEP 2 — ABSTRACT PIPELINE

## 2A. WRITE ABSTRACT
Run:
- writing/prompts/write_abstract.md

## 2B. ABSTRACT CONTROL LOOP
Run in order:
- writing/prompts/abstract_audit.prompt.md
- writing/prompts/abstract_filter.prompt.md
- writing/prompts/abstract_rewrite.prompt.md
- writing/prompts/jargon_detector.prompt.md
- writing/prompts/abstract_score.prompt.md
- writing/prompts/abstract_validate.prompt.md

Decision:
- score >= 90 -> READY
- 80–89 -> one additional safe fix loop
- < 80 -> mark as NOT READY

Output:
- final abstract
- score
- validation report
- remaining risks

---

# STEP 3 — INTRODUCTION PIPELINE

Run:
- writing/run/run_introduction_pipeline.md

Expected internal stages:
- write_introduction
- gap_stress_test
- introduction_audit
- issue_filter
- safe_patch
- reviewer_simulation

Output:
- final Introduction
- status
- top reviewer attacks
- remaining risks

---

# STEP 4 — RELATED WORK PIPELINE

Run:
- writing/run/run_related_work_pipeline.md

Output:
- final Related Work
- balance status
- synthesis quality
- remaining literature risks

---

# STEP 5 — METHODOLOGY PIPELINE

Run:
- writing/run/run_methodology_pipeline.md

Expected internal stages:
- method discovery (code-first)
- write_methodology
- methodology_audit
- contribution alignment check
- issue_filter
- safe_patch
- reproducibility check
- reviewer simulation

Output:
- final Methodology
- code alignment status
- reproducibility verdict
- remaining technical gaps

---

# STEP 5.5 — EXPERIMENTS PIPELINE

Run:
- writing/run/run_experiments_pipeline.md

Expected internal stages:
- Read ai/out/methodology/relocation_queue.json (PENDING items become REQUIRED_CONTENT)
- write_experiments (dataset split, metrics, ablation protocol, oracle setup, transfer setup)
- experiments_audit (E1–E11; writes delivery_report.json — does NOT mutate queue)
- Runner marks PENDING relocation items as DELIVERED after audit PASS
- issue_filter → safe_patch

Output:
- ai/out/experiments/experiments_final.md
- ai/out/experiments/delivery_report.json
- relocation_queue.json updated (DELIVERED status written by runner, not audit)
- arithmetic validation verdict

---

# STEP 6 — CONCLUSION PIPELINE
Run:
- writing/run/run_conclusion_pipeline.md

Output:
- final Conclusion
- conclusion audit status
- remaining overclaim risks

---

## STEP 7 — SECTION IDENTITY VALIDATION (NEW)

Run:

writing/prompts/section_identity_validator.md

Save:
- ai/out/style/section_identity_validation.md

---

### BLOCK CONDITIONS

If:

- CRITICAL section identity issues exist
OR
- argument_chain = NO

→ status = BLOCKED  
→ STOP pipeline

Rationale:
Section misplacement invalidates cross-section reasoning.

---


# STEP 8 — RESULTS VALIDATION

Run:
- writing/prompts/results_validator.md

Goal:
- verify that Results support contributions and claims

Output:
- claim–evidence map
- support status
- comparison analysis
- metric analysis
- reviewer demands
- verdict

If evidence is weak:
- mark final paper as high-risk
- do not hide the issue

---

# STEP 9 — CONTRIBUTION / POSITIONING LAYER

Run in order:

## 9A. GAP STRESS TEST
- writing/prompts/gap_stress_test.md

## 9B. NOVELTY POSITIONING
- writing/prompts/novelty_positioning.md

## 9C. CONTRIBUTION REFINER
- writing/prompts/contribution_refiner.md

Goal:
- ensure the paper’s claims are real, narrow enough, and evidence-backed

Output:
- defensible gap
- novelty type
- refined contributions
- minimal positioning patches

---

# STEP 10 — GLOBAL CONSISTENCY CHECK

Run:
- writing/prompts/cross_consistency.prompt.md

Check:
- title vs abstract
- abstract vs results
- introduction vs methods
- methods vs results
- results vs conclusion
- terminology consistency
- claimed novelty vs actual content

Output:
- cross-consistency report
- severe inconsistencies
- suggested local fixes

If critical inconsistency exists:
- mark paper as NOT READY

---

# STEP 11 — FINAL SUBMISSION GUARD

Run:
- writing/prompts/final_submission_guard.md

Goal:
- simulate editor + reviewers
- decide likely submission outcome

Output:
- global assessment
- reviewer reports
- editor decision
- minimal acceptance path
- risk profile
- final verdict

---

# STEP 12 — JOURNAL STRATEGY

Run:
- writing/prompts/journal_selector.md

Goal:
- recommend best-fit journal category
- define stretch / safe targets
- align positioning

Output:
- journal archetype fit
- submission strategy
- positioning patches
- upgrade path

---

# STEP 13 — FINAL DECISION SYNTHESIS

Aggregate all major outputs into one final paper status.

Determine:

## READY FOR SUBMISSION
Conditions:
- abstract ready
- introduction ready
- methodology reproducible
- results support contributions
- gap defensible
- no critical cross-consistency failures
- final_submission_guard != reject-level

## SUBMIT AFTER MINOR FIXES
Conditions:
- no fatal scientific issues
- only local wording / consistency / positioning issues remain

## REQUIRES MAJOR REVISION

- evidence gaps
- weak but repairable positioning
- critical section-level weaknesses

## HIGH RISK OF REJECTION
Conditions:
- invalid gap
- unsupported contributions
- methodology not reproducible
- results do not support claims

---

## --- NEXT ACTION ---

Choose one:
- submit manuscript
- apply minor survival patch
- revise weak section(s)
- collect missing evidence before continuing
- retarget journal

---

## --- FAILURE HANDLING ---

If any mandatory dependency is missing:
- stop at the earliest safe point
- report exactly what is missing
- do not fabricate downstream outputs

If earlier stages contradict later stages:
- prioritize:
  1. code-grounded findings
  2. literature-grounded findings
  3. results-grounded findings
  4. prose-level claims

---

## --- SELF-CHECK ---

Confirm:
- Literature-based sections were grounded in references/
- Methodology was grounded in code
- Contributions were tested against evidence
- Final decision reflects prior audits, not optimism
- I did not hide fatal issues behind stylistic polish
