description: Write an evidence-grounded Introduction from the manuscript and structured literature extraction
---

ROLE:
Write the Introduction section for the current manuscript.

INPUT:
- Use the currently focused document as the manuscript source.
- Use the structured output of writing/prompts/literature_extract.md as the literature source.
- Treat the manuscript and extracted literature as the sources of truth.
- Do NOT rely on unstated background memory when the manuscript or extracted literature provides the needed evidence.

ALWAYS LOAD:
- writing/policies/STYLE_LOCK-papers.md

MISSION:
Write an Introduction that is argument-driven, literature-grounded, and aligned with the manuscript’s actual contribution.

PRIMARY GOAL:
Construct a clear logical chain:
1. Why the problem matters
2. What existing work has achieved
3. What remains insufficient or unresolved
4. What this paper does
5. Why that contribution matters

CORE PRINCIPLE:
The Introduction must read as an argument, not an inventory.

DO NOT:
- write a citation dump
- summarize papers one by one
- imitate generic journal-introduction wording
- repeat the abstract sentence by sentence
- overclaim novelty
- include low-level implementation details
- turn the section into a methods checklist

SOURCE HIERARCHY:
1. Focused manuscript
2. Structured literature extraction from writing/prompts/literature_extract.md
3. Nothing else

EVIDENCE RULE:
Every claim about prior work must be supportable by the extracted literature.
If the literature extraction does not support a claim, do not write it.

ARGUMENT REQUIREMENTS:
The Introduction must establish:
- the real engineering/scientific problem
- why it is nontrivial
- what categories of existing approaches exist
- what their relevant limitations are
- why those limitations motivate the present work
- what this paper contributes at a high level

MANDATORY STRUCTURE:
Write the Introduction in 4 to 6 paragraphs with this logic:

P1 — Problem context and importance
- Introduce the engineering problem.
- Explain why it matters in practice or scientifically.
- Keep this concrete, not generic.

P2 — Existing approach classes
- Present the main categories of prior work using grouped synthesis.
- Group by modeling philosophy, method family, assumption, or design strategy.
- Compare approaches functionally.
- Use quantitative narration when supported by the extraction.

P3 — Limitation / gap
- Identify what remains insufficient, inconsistent, or unresolved.
- The gap must follow directly from P2.
- The gap must be literature-grounded, not rhetorical.

P4 — This work
- State what the current paper does.
- Explain the high-level approach only.
- Position it against the gap.

P5 — Contribution / implication
- State the main contribution, capability, or significance.
- This may be merged with P4 if the section reads better, but the contribution must remain explicit.

MANDATORY CLOSING RULE:
The paragraph that states “what this paper does” (P4 or merged P4/P5) MUST contain an
explicit objective statement. Acceptable forms:
- “The aim of this study is...”
- “This paper proposes / presents / investigates...”
- “The objective of this work is...”
A reviewer must be able to locate the paper's purpose in a single sentence without inference.
If no such sentence exists, the Introduction fails validation.

OPTIONAL P6 — Paper roadmap
- Include only if journal style expects it or if the section genuinely benefits.
- Keep it brief.
- Avoid mechanical “Section 2 presents...” wording unless needed.

LITERATURE SYNTHESIS RULES:
- Group papers by shared logic, not by author sequence.
- Prefer category-level synthesis over individual paper listing.
- Mention individual papers only when:
  - they are foundational,
  - they define a distinct approach,
  - or they are necessary to support a specific contrast.

GAP-CRITICAL REFERENCE EXCEPTION:
When the gap argument depends on identifying a specific confound or limitation in
specific prior works, those works MUST be named and cited individually.
Group-level synthesis is insufficient when:
- the gap is "prior work X fails to isolate mechanism A from mechanism B"
- the gap is "prior work X reports gains but cannot attribute them to conditioning
  vs shared supervision vs auxiliary loss"

In these cases: name the paper, state the specific limitation, explain why it prevents
the prior result from answering the current research question.

NULL-RESULT PAPERS:
When the paper's contribution is a controlled falsification, the gap paragraph MUST
specify:
(a) the exact confound or alternative explanation that prior work failed to eliminate,
(b) the specific mechanism this paper isolates (e.g., conditioning signal type vs
    gradient coupling),
(c) why that isolation is methodologically sound (e.g., oracle filter, pairwise
    variant decomposition).
Vague "we test X" framing without this structure understates the contribution and
will fail the GAP VALIDITY check in writing/prompts/introduction_audit.md §C.

QUANTITATIVE NARRATION RULE:
When supported by the extracted literature, prefer statements such as:
- typical scale of datasets, studies, or experiments
- typical performance ranges
- typical tradeoffs
- typical computational or modeling limitations

Do not invent numbers.
Do not force numeric statements when the extraction does not support them.

GAP RULE:
A defensible gap must be one of the following:
- an unaddressed engineering condition
- a mismatch between existing assumptions and the current problem
- insufficient treatment of a critical constraint
- lack of evidence under relevant operating conditions
- lack of integration between method classes needed for this paper’s setting

A gap is NOT:
- “no one has studied this”
- “few studies exist”
- “this area is important”
unless directly supported by extracted evidence.

MANUSCRIPT ALIGNMENT RULE:
The Introduction must align with the manuscript’s actual content.
Do not promise:
- experiments not reported
- novelty not demonstrated
- comparisons not included
- validation not performed

STYLE RULES:
- Prefer precise, readable sentences
- Preserve scientific voice
- Avoid inflated claims
- Avoid exaggerated novelty framing
- Avoid repetitive use of “this paper”
- Avoid boilerplate transitions
- Keep narrative flow smooth

ABSTRACTION RULE:
The Introduction should explain:
- what kind of approach is used
- why it is needed
- how it differs conceptually from prior work

It should NOT explain:
- implementation sequence
- parameter settings
- solver details
- low-level algorithm mechanics
unless absolutely necessary for the gap logic

CONTRIBUTION RULE:
State the contribution in a way that is:
- specific
- defensible
- proportional to the evidence

Good contribution framing:
- what problem setting is addressed
- what methodological combination or formulation is proposed
- what practical or scientific capability is demonstrated

Avoid:
- “for the first time”
- “novel and robust”
- “state-of-the-art”
unless explicitly and safely supported

--- RISKS ---
- possible overclaim:

--- SELF-CHECK ---
Confirm:
- The section reads as an argument, not an inventory
- The gap is supported by extracted literature
- No promised contribution exceeds manuscript evidence
- No major prior-work claim depends on unstated memory
- The paper's objective is stated explicitly in a single locatable sentence
- Established knowledge uses present tense; own past work uses past tense (§8.10)
