name: results_manifest_schema
description: Defines the required structure for paper-specific numerical results manifests
---

ROLE:
This schema defines how a paper specifies its authoritative numerical result sources.

PURPOSE:
The results manifest tells the AI system:
- where the valid numerical results are
- which experiments matter
- which metrics are primary
- which files must be ignored
- how results should be compared and reported

CORE PRINCIPLE:
The manifest is the source of truth for result selection.
If a file or experiment is not authorized by the manifest, it must not be used in the numerical results subsection.

---

# REQUIRED SECTIONS

## 1. PAPER CONTEXT

Fields:
- paper_id
- paper_title
- domain
- result_scope

Purpose:
Identify which paper the manifest belongs to and what kind of numerical results are expected.

Example:
- paper_id: arm_z_topopt
- domain: topology optimization / robotics
- result_scope: numerical structural optimization results

---

## 2. AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES

Fields:
- authoritative_files
- authoritative_directories
- preferred_formats

Purpose:
List the files and folders that contain valid numerical results.

Rules:
- paths must be relative to repository root
- only these paths may be used by writing/prompts/write_numerical_results.md unless explicitly expanded later

---

## 3. EXCLUDED SOURCES

Fields:
- ignored_files
- ignored_directories
- stale_patterns

Purpose:
Prevent use of:
- debug outputs
- archived results
- preliminary runs
- temporary files
- manually superseded versions

Example stale patterns:
- "*debug*"
- "*tmp*"
- "*old*"
- "*draft*"
- "*v1*" when replaced by final validated output

---

## 4. EXPERIMENT GROUPS

Each experiment group must define:
- id
- name
- purpose
- source_files
- status
- include_in_paper

Optional traceability fields:
- raw_run_directories
- provenance_files
- checkpoint_sources
- selection_filter
- aggregation_unit

Rules:
- `source_files` contains explicit reporting artifacts used to write numerical claims.
  For included final groups, each entry must be a file, not a directory.
- `raw_run_directories` records per-run training outputs for traceability only. Never
  aggregate every file in these directories implicitly.
- `provenance_files` records upstream summaries used to construct reporting artifacts.
- `checkpoint_sources` records checkpoint locations separately from metric sources.
- `selection_filter` is required when a reporting artifact contains rows from multiple
  tasks, protocols, or experiment types.
- `aggregation_unit` declares whether `n` counts distinct seeds, completed attempts, or
  another explicitly defined unit. Never infer independent replicates from row count.

Allowed status values:
- final
- exploratory
- deprecated
- failed

Allowed include_in_paper values:
- yes
- no

Purpose:
Group files into interpretable experiment blocks such as:
- baseline comparison
- ablation study
- sensitivity analysis
- robustness check

---

## 5. PRIMARY METRICS

For each metric define:
- id
- name
- meaning
- unit
- higher_is_better / lower_is_better / target_range
- reporting_priority

Purpose:
Tell the system which metrics matter most and how to interpret them.

Examples:
- volume_reduction [%]
- max_stress [MPa]
- tip_displacement [mm]
- buckling_factor [-]
- mIoU [%]
- Dice [-]

---

## 6. REPORTING PRIORITY

Fields:
- primary_result
- primary_comparison
- secondary_results
- optional_results

Purpose:
Tell writing/prompts/write_numerical_results.md what to report first.

Example:
1. main engineering outcome
2. strategy comparison
3. robustness result

---

## 7. COMPARISON RULES

Fields:
- valid_comparisons
- forbidden_comparisons
- aggregation_rules
- final_run_rule
- duplicate_run_policy

Purpose:
Prevent invalid or misleading comparisons.

Examples:
- compare only experiments with same mesh resolution
- compare only final validated runs
- do not average across different random seeds unless specified
- do not compare exploratory runs to final reported runs
- do not aggregate repeated raw-run tuples without an explicit approved-run selection

---

## 8. CLAIM LINKS

Fields:
- contribution_to_result_map
- claim_to_metric_map

Purpose:
Connect result reporting to the actual paper claims.

Example:
- claim: envelope approach is more conservative
- supporting metric: material volume / stress distribution
- experiment group: strategy_comparison

---

## 9. WRITING CONSTRAINTS

Fields:
- max_key_findings
- max_metrics_per_paragraph
- must_report
- must_not_report
- interpretation_notes

Purpose:
Control the style and selectivity of the generated numerical results subsection.

---

## 10. RUN ACCOUNTING (benchmark and ablation papers)

Optional section. Include when the paper reports a specific count of training runs.

Fields:

```
nominal_formula   string    The multiplication that produced nominal_runs,
                            e.g. "2 × 7 × 4 × 3"
nominal_runs      integer   The count produced by the nominal formula before any reruns
rerun_cells       array     One entry per cell with additional completed attempts (see below)
actual_rows       integer   nominal_runs + sum(rerun_cells[*].added_runs)
ablation_runs     integer   Runs from standalone ablation studies
joint_runs        integer   Runs from joint multi-task or conditioning experiments
total_runs        integer   actual_rows + ablation_runs + joint_runs
```

Rerun cell entry:
```
cell         string    Human-readable cell identifier, e.g. "ConvNeXt-Seg/damage"
added_runs   integer   Number of additional completed attempts for this cell (positive integer)
reason       string    Why this cell was extended (required, non-empty)
```

Definition: a rerun is an additional completed attempt for an EXISTING cell (same
architecture × task × loss combination). It may use a new seed or reuse a previous seed;
do not describe repeated attempts as additional distinct seeds unless the records prove
that. A rerun is NOT a new cell or a new experiment group. This definition prevents
double-counting and unsupported independence claims when reporting totals.

Arithmetic identities (validated by writing/prompts/results_manifest_validator.md):
  actual_rows = nominal_runs + sum(rerun_cells[*].added_runs)
  total_runs  = actual_rows + ablation_runs + joint_runs

Population instructions:
  - nominal_formula and nominal_runs: derive from the benchmark grid definition in the paper
  - rerun_cells: list every cell extended beyond its initial seed set with the reason
  - actual_rows, total_runs: compute from the identities above; do not guess
  - ablation_runs and joint_runs: count from distinct experiment groups with
    purpose containing "ablation" or "joint"

Example:
```json
"run_accounting": {
  "nominal_formula": "2 × 7 × 4 × 3",
  "nominal_runs": 168,
  "rerun_cells": [
    {"cell": "ConvNeXt-Seg/damage", "added_runs": 3,
     "reason": "higher-than-expected variance on damage task"},
    {"cell": "DeepLabV3+/damage", "added_runs": 1,
     "reason": "initial seed showed outlier performance"}
  ],
  "actual_rows": 172,
  "ablation_runs": 86,
  "joint_runs": 15,
  "total_runs": 273
}
```

# VALIDATION RULES

## Required:
- at least one authoritative source
- at least one experiment group with include_in_paper = yes
- at least one primary metric
- at least one reporting priority entry

## Forbidden:
- empty authoritative source list
- using ignored paths as authoritative
- experiment groups with source files outside declared authoritative sources

# OUTPUT EXPECTATION

A valid manifest must enable:
- deterministic selection of result files
- deterministic exclusion of stale/debug files
- prioritized reporting of findings
- safe comparison logic

---

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTE

The manifest should be stored as:

- ai/config/results_manifest.json

Optional human-readable companion:
- ai/config/results_manifest.md
