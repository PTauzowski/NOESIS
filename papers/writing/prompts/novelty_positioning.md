description: Align the paper’s contribution with defensible novelty claims and target journal expectations
---

ROLE:
Act as a senior editor + reviewer hybrid responsible for evaluating and positioning the paper’s novelty.

INPUT:
- Use the currently focused manuscript
- Use outputs of:
  - writing/prompts/gap_stress_test.md
  - writing/prompts/literature_extract.md
  - writing/prompts/literature_balance.md
- Use Introduction and Related Work if available

ALWAYS LOAD:
- writing/policies/STYLE_LOCK-papers.md

MISSION:
Determine:
- what the paper actually contributes
- what kind of novelty it represents
- how it should be positioned for publication
- what claims must be softened or removed

DO NOT:
- rewrite the full manuscript
- invent new contributions
- inflate novelty
- ignore gap_stress_test conclusions

CORE PRINCIPLE:
Novelty is not what the authors claim—it is what survives comparison with literature and evidence.

# CORE TASKS

## 1. ACTUAL CONTRIBUTION EXTRACTION

Identify what the paper truly delivers:

- problem setting
- method components
- methodological changes (if any)
- integration aspects
- validation / evidence

Output:
- What is actually new:
- What is reused:
- What is combined:

---

## 2. NOVELTY TYPE CLASSIFICATION

Classify the contribution:

Choose primary and secondary types:

- methodological novelty (new algorithm/formulation)
- integration novelty (combination of known methods)
- problem-setting novelty (new formulation of problem)
- constraint novelty (new constraints/conditions handled)
- evidence novelty (new validation / benchmark / dataset)
- application novelty (known method applied to new domain)
- negative / null-result novelty (disproving assumption)

Output:
- Primary novelty type:
- Secondary novelty type:

---

## 3. NOVELTY STRENGTH

Evaluate strength:

- strong (clear methodological advance)
- moderate (clear integration or problem-setting contribution)
- limited (mainly application or validation)
- weak (repackaging)

Also assess:
- risk of reviewer rejection due to novelty

---

## 4. ALIGNMENT WITH GAP

Using gap_stress_test:

Check:
- does the contribution match the defensible gap?
- is anything overstated?
- is anything missing?

Output:
- aligned elements:
- misaligned elements:
- overclaimed elements:

---

## 5. JOURNAL EXPECTATION MATCHING

Simulate expectations for typical venues:

### A. High-tier methods journal (e.g., C&S)
Expect:
- clear methodological contribution
- strong validation
- theoretical or algorithmic advancement

### B. Applied engineering journal (e.g., Automation in Construction)
Expect:
- strong engineering relevance
- realistic validation
- practical insight

### C. Broad / MDPI-style journal
Expect:
- clear contribution
- reasonable validation
- readable narrative

For each:

- suitability:
- required positioning:
- risk level:

---

## 6. CLAIM SANITIZATION

Identify:

### Must REMOVE
- unsupported novelty claims
- exaggerated phrases
- “for the first time” (unless provable)

### Must SOFTEN
- overgeneralized statements
- broad claims of impact

### Must KEEP
- defensible, evidence-backed contributions

---

## 7. MINIMAL REPOSITIONING

Provide **surgical adjustments**, not rewrites.

Examples:

- shift from:
  “novel framework”
  → “a two-scale formulation for …”

- shift from:
  “significantly improves”
  → “demonstrates comparable performance while …”
