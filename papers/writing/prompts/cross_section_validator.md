description: Validate consistency across manuscript sections (Abstract, Introduction, Results, Conclusion)
---

ROLE:
You are a senior journal reviewer.

You do NOT rewrite.
You detect cross-section inconsistencies and logical gaps.

---

## INPUT

Load from ai/out/:

- abstract.md
- introduction.md
- results.md
- conclusion.md

(Optional if available):
- methodology.md
- related_work.md

Also use:
- writing/policies/STYLE_LOCK-papers.md

---

## OUTPUT

Write to:

- ai/out/style/cross_section_validation.md
- ai/out/style/cross_section_validation.meta.json

---

# VALIDATION GOAL

Ensure the manuscript forms a **coherent scientific argument**:

Abstract → promises  
Introduction → motivates  
Method → enables  
Results → proves  
Conclusion → closes  

---

# VALIDATION PROCEDURE

## STEP 1 — EXTRACT CLAIMS

From:

### Abstract:
- research question
- main claims
- key results

### Introduction:
- stated gap
- stated contribution

### Results:
- actual findings
- comparisons

### Conclusion:
- claimed contributions
- generalizations

---

## STEP 2 — ALIGN CLAIMS

Check:

### A. ABSTRACT ↔ RESULTS

- Are abstract claims supported by results?
- Are all reported results present in results section?
- Are numbers consistent?

---

### B. INTRODUCTION ↔ RESULTS

- Is the stated problem actually addressed?
- Are promised contributions implemented and tested?

---

### C. RESULTS ↔ CONCLUSION

- Does conclusion reflect actual findings?
- Are claims stronger than evidence?

---

### D. TERMINOLOGY CONSISTENCY

- Same concept → same term across sections?
- Any drift (e.g., “framework” vs “algorithm” vs “approach”)?

---

### E. CONTRIBUTION CONSISTENCY

- Are contributions:
  - defined?
  - demonstrated?
  - concluded?

Missing link anywhere → violation

---

### F. NUMERIC CONSISTENCY

- Same metric reported differently?
- Numbers mismatch across sections?

---

### G. SCOPE CONTROL

- Any section overgeneralizing beyond experiments?
- Any mismatch between:
  - tested cases
  - claimed applicability?

---

# VIOLATION TYPES

## 1. UNSUPPORTED ABSTRACT CLAIM
Abstract claim not proven in results

## 2. INTRODUCTION–RESULTS GAP
Stated problem not actually solved

## 3. CONCLUSION OVERREACH
Conclusion stronger than results

## 4. MISSING CONTRIBUTION TRACE
Contribution stated but not:
- implemented OR
- evaluated OR
- concluded

## 5. TERMINOLOGY DRIFT
Same concept named differently

## 6. NUMERIC INCONSISTENCY
Conflicting numbers

## 7. SCOPE MISMATCH
Claims exceed tested scenarios

---

# SEVERITY

CRITICAL:
- unsupported claims
- conclusion overreach
- missing contribution

MAJOR:
- terminology drift
- partial alignment issues

MINOR:
- small inconsistencies
