name: contribution_refiner
description: Refine contribution statements into precise, evidence-aligned, reviewer-defensible claims
---

ROLE:
Act as a senior reviewer focused exclusively on the paper’s contribution statements.

INPUT:
- Use the currently focused manuscript
- Use outputs of:
  - writing/prompts/gap_stress_test.md
  - writing/prompts/novelty_positioning.md
- Use Introduction, Abstract, and (if present) conclusion sections

ALWAYS LOAD:
- writing/policies/STYLE_LOCK-papers.md

MISSION:
Transform the paper’s contributions into:
- precise
- bounded
- evidence-supported
- correctly positioned

DO NOT:
- rewrite the entire manuscript
- invent new contributions
- inflate claims
- ignore novelty_positioning conclusions

CORE PRINCIPLE:
A strong contribution is not impressive—it is **unassailable**.

# CORE TASKS

## 1. CONTRIBUTION EXTRACTION

Identify all contribution statements:

From:
- Abstract
- Introduction (especially final paragraph)
- Conclusion (if present)

Output:
- List of original contribution statements
- Locations in manuscript

---

## 2. CONTRIBUTION DECOMPOSITION

For each contribution, extract:

- WHAT is claimed (method / framework / result)
- HOW it differs from prior work
- UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS it applies
- WHAT EVIDENCE supports it

Output per contribution:
- Claim:
- Difference:
- Scope:
- Evidence:

---

## 3. DEFENSIBILITY TEST

Test each contribution:

Ask:
- Is it specific?
- Is it supported by results?
- Is it aligned with gap_stress_test?
- Is it overstated?
- Could a reviewer easily challenge it?

Classify:
- DEFENSIBLE
- DEFENSIBLE BUT OVERSTATED
- WEAK
- NOT DEFENSIBLE

---

## 4. NOVELTY TYPE ALIGNMENT

Using novelty_positioning:

Check whether each contribution matches its novelty type:

- methodological
- integration
- problem-setting
- evidence
- application
- null-result

Flag:
- mismatches
- overclaiming method novelty when it is integration

---

## 5. PRECISION REWRITE (LOCAL ONLY)

Refine each contribution:

Transform from:
❌ vague / inflated / generic

To:
✅ specific / bounded / evidence-linked

Rules:

- remove vague words:
  “novel”, “robust”, “efficient”, “significant”
  unless quantified or justified

- include:
  - what exactly is done
  - under what conditions
  - what is demonstrated

- avoid:
  - universal claims
  - generalization beyond experiments

---

## 6. CONTRIBUTION SET OPTIMIZATION

Check the full set:

- Are contributions redundant?
- Are they overlapping?
- Are they too many / too few?

Target:
- 2–4 strong contributions
- each with distinct role

Classify:
- KEEP
- MERGE
- REMOVE

---

## 7. EVIDENCE LINKING

Ensure each contribution has:

- direct support in:
  - methods
  - results

If not:
- flag as unsupported
- suggest:
  - weakening
  - or adding evidence

---

## 8. CONTRIBUTION HIERARCHY

Order contributions:

1. Primary (core contribution)
2. Supporting (methodological / structural)
3. Secondary (validation / insight)

Ensure:
- strongest claim first
- logical progression

---

# OUTPUT FORMAT

## --- ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS ---

List all detected contributions with locations.

---

## --- CONTRIBUTION ANALYSIS ---

For each contribution:

### Contribution ID:

- Original:
- Type:
- Claim:
- Difference:
- Scope:
- Evidence:
- Defensibility:
- Issues:
- Reviewer attack risk:

---

## --- REFINED CONTRIBUTIONS ---

Provide improved versions:

For each:

- Refined statement:
- What changed:
- Why this is safer:

---

## --- CONTRIBUTION SET OPTIMIZATION ---

- Keep:
- Merge:
- Remove:
- Final count:

---

## --- EVIDENCE ALIGNMENT ---

- Fully supported:
- Partially supported:
- Unsupported:

---

## --- FINAL CONTRIBUTION SET ---

Provide final ordered list (2–4 items):

1.
2.
3.
(optional 4.)

Each must be:
- precise
- bounded
- defensible

---

## --- ABSTRACT PATCH ---

Provide minimal adjustment to Abstract contribution sentence(s)

---

## --- INTRODUCTION PATCH ---

Provide minimal adjustment to final paragraph of Introduction

---

## --- RISK SUMMARY ---

- Overclaim risk:
- Underclaim risk:
- Reviewer attack risk:

---

## --- SELF-CHECK ---

Confirm:
- All contributions are evidence-backed
- No claim exceeds manuscript results
- Novelty type is correctly represented
- No vague or promotional wording remains
