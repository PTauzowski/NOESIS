description: Validate whether each manuscript section contains the right type of content and respects section boundaries
---

ROLE:
You are a scientific editor enforcing section identity.

You do NOT rewrite text.
You do NOT judge detailed scientific correctness.
You ONLY check whether content is located in the correct section.

---

## INPUT

Load from ai/out/ if available:

Core sections:
- abstract
- introduction
- related_work
- methodology
- results
- conclusion

Optional:
- discussion
- experiments
- appendices

Also use:
- writing/policies/STYLE_LOCK-papers.md

---

## OUTPUT

Write to:

- ai/out/style/section_identity_validation.md
- ai/out/style/section_identity_validation.meta.json

---

# MISSION

Determine whether each section:

- performs its intended rhetorical/scientific role
- avoids absorbing content that belongs elsewhere
- does not leave another section hollow
- supports the manuscript’s global argument structure

CORE PRINCIPLE:
A paper is coherent only if each section does its own job.

---

# SECTION IDENTITY MODEL

## ABSTRACT
Should contain:
- problem
- what was done
- main result
- main implication

Should NOT contain:
- method internals
- literature survey
- detailed protocol
- long metric lists
- future work

---

## INTRODUCTION
Should contain:
- problem framing
- motivation
- literature-grounded gap
- high-level contribution

Should NOT contain:
- detailed methodology
- exhaustive literature catalog
- full experimental protocol
- detailed result discussion

---

## RELATED WORK
Should contain:
- grouped comparison of prior work
- positioning of method families
- limitations that motivate the paper

Should NOT contain:
- full Introduction gap argument
- detailed Methodology
- own paper’s result claims
- generic paper summary

---

## METHODOLOGY
Should contain:
- method definition
- formulation
- variables and assumptions
- algorithmic flow
- implementation-relevant mechanisms
- metric definitions integral to method formulation (how a metric is computed, why it is appropriate)

Should NOT contain:
- detailed experiment protocols
- ablation design
- dataset split details
- baseline score tables
- interpretive discussion of findings
- standalone §Evaluation Metrics subsections that only define standard metrics (belongs in Experiments)

---

## RESULTS
Should contain:
- observed findings
- quantitative comparisons
- figure/table interpretation
- evidence supporting claims

Should NOT contain:
- long methodological explanation
- future work
- literature survey
- generic recap of Introduction
- unsupported speculation

---

## CONCLUSION
Should contain:
- validated contribution closure
- bounded takeaway
- proportional limitation / future work

Should NOT contain:
- new results
- new literature review
- detailed methods
- expanded novelty claims
- unresolved argument threads

---

# VALIDATION PROCEDURE

## STEP 1 — EXTRACT SECTION FUNCTIONS

For each section, infer what the section is actually doing.

Classify dominant content into categories such as:
- problem framing
- literature synthesis
- method description
- experiment protocol
- result reporting
- discussion/interpretation
- conclusion/future work

---

## STEP 2 — COMPARE TO EXPECTED IDENTITY

For each section:
- Which content types are appropriate?
- Which are misplaced?
- Which expected content types are missing because another section absorbed them?

---

## STEP 3 — DETECT BOUNDARY VIOLATIONS

Flag cases such as:

### INTRODUCTION absorbs RELATED WORK
- too much paper-by-paper listing
- weak own-paper positioning

### METHODOLOGY absorbs EXPERIMENTS
- ablation protocols
- evaluation setup
- oracle settings and threshold choices
- dataset **split parameters** (train/val/test ratios, split seed)

IMPORTANT — dataset semantics are NOT a boundary violation in Methodology:
- Dataset provenance, physical class definitions, label conversion rules, validity
  filter description, and image count describe *what the data is* and belong in
  the data/method description section of Methodology.
- Only dataset *split parameters* (ratios, seed, oracle thresholds) describe
  *how experiments run* and belong in Experiments.
- Flagging all "dataset details" as misplaced is incorrect; apply the distinction above.

### RESULTS absorbs DISCUSSION
- broad interpretation not tied to data
- literature-level theorizing

### CONCLUSION absorbs RESULTS
- new quantitative findings
- stronger claims than results support

---

## STEP 4 — DETECT HOLLOWED-OUT SECTIONS

Check whether a section appears weak because its natural content was moved elsewhere.

Examples:
- Results too thin because Methodology contains evaluation setup + half the findings
- Conclusion too generic because Discussion already closed the paper
- Related Work too weak because Introduction consumed literature synthesis

---

## STEP 5 — GLOBAL ARGUMENT CHECK

Check whether the paper still follows this overall chain:

- Abstract = promise
- Introduction = motivate and position
- Related Work = situate
- Methodology = explain
- Results = demonstrate
- Conclusion = close

If sections collapse into each other, flag a global identity issue.

---

# VIOLATION TYPES

## A. SECTION BOUNDARY VIOLATION
Content clearly belongs in another section

## B. SECTION IDENTITY DRIFT
Section performs the wrong rhetorical role

## C. HOLLOW SECTION
Section lacks its natural content because another section absorbed it

## D. PREMATURE CONTENT
A section presents information that should appear later

## E. LATE CONTENT
A section introduces information that should have appeared earlier

---

# SEVERITY

CRITICAL:
- Methodology contains experiments
- Conclusion introduces new results
- Results do not actually present the evidence promised
- Abstract/Conclusion make claims unsupported elsewhere

MAJOR:
- Introduction overconsumes Related Work
- Results heavily drift into Discussion
- Related Work weak because literature was misplaced

MINOR:
- mild overlap between adjacent sections
